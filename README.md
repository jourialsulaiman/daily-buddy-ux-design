# Daily Buddy – UX Design Project

Daily Buddy is a user-centered UX design project that focuses on helping children (ages 6–12) build healthy daily routines while reducing parental stress.  
The solution combines a **mobile application for parents** with a **smartwatch interface for children** to support task management, motivation, health tracking, and safety.

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project was developed following a full **UX design lifecycle**, including user research, ideation, prototyping, and usability testing.  
The goal was to design an intuitive, engaging, and safe system that supports children’s independence while giving parents reassurance and control.

Daily Buddy addresses common challenges such as:
- Children forgetting daily tasks and routines
- Dependence on constant parental reminders
- Parental anxiety about child safety and health
