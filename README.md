# Daily Buddy – UX Design & Prototype

Daily Buddy is a user-centered UX design project focused on helping children (ages 6–12) build healthy daily routines while reducing parental stress.  
The solution combines a **mobile application for parents** with a **smartwatch interface for children** to support task management, motivation, health tracking, and safety.

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project follows a complete **UX design process**, from user research and ideation to prototyping and usability testing.  
The goal was to design an intuitive, engaging, and safe system that encourages children’s independence while giving parents reassurance and control.

Daily Buddy addresses challenges such as:
- Children forgetting daily tasks and routines  
- Dependence on constant parental reminders  
- Low motivation toward healthy habits  
- Parental concerns about safety and well-being
